the conversation that makes previous context less relevant. This helps keep
the conversation focused and manageable.

When to use this tool:
1. The user switches from one coding task to a completely different one
2. The conversation has become very long and earlier messages are no longer relevant
3. The user explicitly asks to start fresh or change topics
4. You're working on a different part of the codebase that's unrelated to previous discussion

Do NOT use this tool:
- For minor topic shifts within the same general task
- When previous context is still relevant to the current discussion
- Early in conversations that aren't yet lengthy

The tool will preserve important context while removing outdated information.]],
